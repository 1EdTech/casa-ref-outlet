# CASA Outlet

The [Community App Sharing Architecture (CASA)](http://imsglobal.github.io/casa) provides a mechanism for
discovering and sharing metadata about web resources such as websites, mobile
apps and LTI tools. It models real-world decision-making through extensible
attributes, filter and transform operations, flexible peering relationships,
etc.

This Javascript application is part of the CASA reference implementation. It
is an outlet that implements the CASA Local Module interface. Out of the box,
it supports the LTI ContentItemSelectionRequest as an integration method when
run with rack, but its adapter-based architecture also allows for other
integrations.
